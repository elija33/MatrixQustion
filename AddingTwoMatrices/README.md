                                    Adding Two Matrices
The addition is one of the easiest opearations to carry out. The same holds true for matrices. Two matrices can be added only if they havae the same dimensions. The elements at similar positions get added.

Given two matrices A and B having (n1 X m1) and (n2 x m2) dimensions respectively. Add A and B.

Example 1 :
Input:
n1 = 2, m1 = 3
A[][] = {{1, 2, 3},
         {4, 5, 6}}

n2 = 2, m2 = 3
B[][] = {{1, 3, 3},
         {2, 3, 3}}

Output: 2 5 6 6 8 9
Explanation:
The summation matrix of A and B is:
res[][] = {{2, 5, 6},
           {6, 8, 9}}
The output is generated by traversing each
row sequentially.

Example 2 :

Input:
n1 = 3, m1 = 2
A[][] = {{1, 2},
         {3, 4}, 
         {5, 6}}

n2 = 3, m2 = 2
B[][] = {{1, 3},
          {3, 2},
         {3, 3}}
Output: 2 5 6 6 8 9
