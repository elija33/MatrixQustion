# MatrixQustion

                        Change all elements of row `i` and column `j` in a matrix to 0 if cell `(i, j)` is 0

Given an M Ã— N matrix consisting of only 0 or 1, change all elements of row i and column j to 0 if cell (i, j) has value 0. Do this without using any extra space for every (i, j) having value 0.

For Example:
input :
        [ 1  1  0  1  1 ]
        [ 1  1  1  1  1 ]
        [ 1  1  1  0  1 ]
        [ 1  1  1  1  1 ]
        [ 0  1  1  1  1 ]

Output :
        [ 0  0  0  0  0 ]
        [ 0  1  0  0  1 ]
        [ 0  0  0  0  0 ]
        [ 0  1  0  0  1 ]
        [ 0  0  0  0  0 ]
